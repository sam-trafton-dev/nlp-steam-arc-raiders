netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.95,"game is alright, but desync is a major issue and the higher tiered weapons are so unbelievably unbalanced they don't even feel fair to use, might be an unpopular opinion but I also don't find the 3rd person perspective PvP fun and leads to really stale fights, feels really good when you shoot someone behind the wall because they peeked to shoot you, and you shot after they got behind cover but this is the wanted universe so you curved your bullet and headshot them 3 times behind cover. PvE is really good tho, but this isn't a PvE game now is it"

netcode/desync,Optimize server synchronization to reduce desync and improve overall stability.,0.8,"The amount of hacks in this game is insane . and for those saying none exist there the ones hacking Ive been shown multiple hacks, including one that shows where everyone is at all times on maps and what gear they have if they are legendary on anything you will show that color so hackers hunt those people they use the same hack to know exactly what crates to loot there auto aimeres there is shield hacks to double shield strength it is just out of control !"
performance/fps,Optimize AI behavior and rebalance weapon damage curves to improve fairness in multiplayer matches.,0.95,Game is bad. AI is too strong. 3 vs 1 with stuns and full autos. Not worth playing in that situation. Game was so much better during the server slam.
other,Improve gameplay mechanics and add more customization options,0.8,"I recently played this game and I have some thoughts on it. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience playing this game. The graphics were stunning and the gameplay was smooth. However, there are a few things that could be improved to make the game even better."
netcode/desync,"optimize server synchronization, rebalance weapon damage curves",0.8,"First time i downloaded it I got 'can't launch due to Corrupted files ' message., So i uninstalled reinstalled. Now i can play. I played 3 matches no problem. Although now 6 times in a row . People have been using a hack where screen goes black and then your away from them or match is over you can see again. There is also the lag hack which lags you 'even lagging you out of the game'. It was fun up until that point , no point in playing now."

netcode/desync,"optimize server synchronization, rebalance weapon damage curves",0.8,"The 5 hours I've played, I can't even play with friends. Whenever my friend joins it doesn't even say he's in the party. People get good stuff playing solo and then go into groups to grieve spawn. Horrible experience. Good luck even trying to get matchmaking to work."

netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,1.0,great game however the game starting crashing every game after about 40 hours of gameplay with no reason. Didn't update anything.
pvp experience,Add a camera give-away feature to reduce camping behavior,1.0,"Suffers the same issue that any third-person pvp game will have, many matches consist of somebody who got to the high-loot zone first holding an angle until you walk into them. Even longer distance fights are just a camp-fest with your opponent just watching you with your camera until the first man who gets impatient makes a move and loses. Needs to add some sort of camera give-away otherwise this may grind you down like it did with me, if you're used to more skill-based pvp action. Graphics, sounds and optimisation are all great though."
netcode/desync,"optimize server synchronization, rebalance weapon damage curves",0.8,Good foundation but missing a lot of important QOL features as well as some game breaking server issues. Its basically Tarkov but without needing it to be a full time job to get decent/good gear. Doesn't have duo queue right now which means you end up fighting 2v3 every raid and burn your kits.
netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,1.0,Crashes
netcode/desync,Optimize server synchronization,0.8,"I cannot in good conscience recommend this game, despite its fun gameplay and environments. The use of AI for voicelines is not something I can look past, even if it appears more nuanced and ethical than most others who use it. We know of the use of it for voices, but we don't know where else it may be used. We have promises that that is all and that it was done with the VA's consent. But promises are just words. Eventually, someone will ask 'what else can we use it on?'"

netcode/desync,"optimize server synchronization, rebalance weapon damage curves",0.8,"Game's fun af.. When it works. For whatever reason I lose connection to the game within 30 seconds of reconnecting, and given the pvp nature of this game, by the time i reconnect I am dead. My friends do not have those issues apparently so you think it's an issue with my pc or connection, right? Well a quick google search showed that many people are having the same issues as me, several ""workarounds"" being available. I just find it mad to spend £40 on a game and not be able to just install and play it out of the box. I am so tired of games being riddled with game breaking issues, to just magically make the game usable 1 year after release."
netcode/desync,Optimize server synchronization to reduce lag and improve responsiveness.,0.8,"I’m a big fan of extraction shooters. I’ve got a few hundred hours in both Tarkov and Delta Force. I’ve also spent a decent amount of time with smaller titles like Level Zero: Extraction, Arcane Legends, and Shadowgun Warriors."

This is the game for yo Broken weapons, hackers galore, and a community that somehow manages to be more toxic than Rivals currently makes for an all around shitty experience. And on the off chance you actually have fun, karma will soon round the corner and you'll have the worst experience of your life for the next two hours. Don't fucking buy it."

weapon/ai balance,rebalance weapon damage curves,0.8,I get pvp is apart of the game but the pvp system is just dogshit
netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.95,Game was fun first week but it is unplayable now due to desync. The game shows you in two locations at once and zooms back and forth between the two so you cannot do anything. It didn't do this before this last patch so hopefully they can figure it out and I can play it again because its a fun game minus the game breaking bug.
netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.8,a great extraction shooter for 3rd person and majority PvE. it gets ruthless above ground. i will play 5 games loot and leave no problem. but on that 6th game out of nowhere i have 2 squads pooping down my neck at the same time.

It isn't fun spending so much time looting, then just dying by some random sniping you from 4 screens away. I wish this game was more PvE, as it does have great game mechanics."
netcode/desync,Optimize server synchronization to reduce lag and improve control responsiveness.,0.8,I was not impressed with this game. It felt like a racket/ I would rather it was free to play then after I buy the game it hits me up for more money. If you are selling a game your going to learn an increasing number of people don't want to buy in-game funding just to get stuff. Hard pass on this one... Also had control issues where the game kept glitching back and forth between mouse or controller.

netcode/desync,Optimize server synchronization and rebalance weapon damage curves to improve PvP experience.,0.8,"Game is honestly just not fun, I've grinded the game since launch, at the start players played more aggressive, pvp was more fun, but lately its just rats everywhere treating the game like tarkov, ruins the whole experience. Not to mentions the tasks don't add much meaning to the game they finish very quickly and give meaningless rewards, so apart from grinding money runs, or wasting your time searching for a fair pvp fight there is not much to do in the game."

weapon/ai balance,Implement optional PvP mode or improve balance of gear sets and player levels for PvP play.,0.8,"Game definitely needs a PvE only mode... the second I run across other players I don't stand a chance with crappy limited gear sets, vs those at higher levels. Although I really enjoy playing against enemies, the player vs player elements are simply frustrating and with most of the others at a far higher level, this is simply not enjoyable at all. Make PvP optional, as this is sadly not enjoyable as it stands, despite a good premise and potential."
netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,1.0,"untill the server problems is fixed i will not recommend this game, in no other game do i have this much stutter, freezing and other bullshit"

weapon/ai balance,Improve PvP balance by adjusting Suturer's damage and making arcs less common in PvP battles.,0.8,"Game is amazing. Community is fun, roleplay and often friendly. Power of arcs (enemies in pve) is the best point because players have to think if they play solo/pvp/team. A pvp battle with arcs near, can be a game changer :) . Many interactions with surprises and unknow elements. Maps are beautiful and great. Stuff is interesting. I like a lot."

netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.9,"The game forces you to go into one last extract towards the ends of rounds and there is usually a full team crouched, corner peaking the entrances.

netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.95,Would definitely NOT spend your money on this game no matter how many streamers play it.

Fun game to many issues not worth it AVOID.

You won't like this game. The first time you get shot while extracting, you'll remember that you're too old for this shit. Let the kids have their PvPvE extraction shooters and go play a game that is guaranteed to respect your time regardless of if a kid shoots you in the face or not.

No hate on the game, its players, or anything else - this is for all the old folks like me griping for a PvE mode."

other,Improve gameplay diversity,0.8,"Mid disguised as Peak. Presentation is amazing but the gameplay is the same extraction shooter loop you've seen before. The Arc PvE is nowhere near as much of a game changer as it makes itself out to be. The raider PvP doesn't really know what it wants to be. It heavily favors the defender due to the 3rd person view. The weapon variety is pretty minimal as the weapons are either underpowered, or are the same assault rifle / lmg / shotgun / sniper combo you've been playing with since the stone ages."

netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.95,"Arc Raiders is a game I’ve been looking forward for since The Finals, and now that it's finally here, I'm loving it. The retro sci-fi vibe really hits the spot it's like a cool mix of nostalgia and fresh design. The music is super catchy, and honestly, I never even think about turning it down, even after hours of playing. The PvP is amazing, If you’ve played The Last of Us, you’ll know what I mean when I say the combat is all about using your environment. Chasing someone across rooftops, dodging arcs, and trying to outsmart them is just so much fun. The PvE can be hit or miss; it has its frustrating moments, but those challenges make you want to keep going. As for the cosmetics, they're pretty basic; I’m good with what we have.

My biggest problem with the game is balance. Traditionally in other extraction shooters you quest and loot to unlock consistent access to better gear over time which feels rewarding. One night raid with the free loadout and you're looting purple guns from weapons cases anywhere on the map. The item economy in this game feels too random and unpredictable. I also dislike how some weapons feel underpowered compared to others.
netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.9,"The game is awesome, the looting, the AI is top tier, fighting the machines is FUN as hell but the Desync issues need to be addressed, because the game is constantly suffering from them and what is the point of looting like hell and preparing, having the best gear, just for some random Desync to screw you over?

netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization to prevent crashes,0.9,I’m not very good at shooters but was really enjoying this game. Grinded out a decent little loadout for myself… then going into a game steam shuts it down to verify. Come back and load in to me dying THANKS A BUNCH STEAM YOU BELL ENDS! Still an enjoyable game just that one gripe really
netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.8,"As someone who’s spent plenty of time in Tarkov, Warzone, and other looter/extraction shooters, I just don’t get the hype around this game."

pve/mission loop,Improve enemy variety and reduce third-party interactions,0.9,"The game is great for the first ~50 hours, but after that it becomes really repetitive and boring. You can clearly see the inspiration from The Cycle: Frontier, but the developer failed to execute on some of its core mechanics. The lack of variety in enemy types and the constant third-partying make this game exhausting."

performance/fps,optimize weapon balance,0.8,shit game
netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.8,"It's hard to find reasons not to recommend this game. $40 price despite the fact that games of lesser quality charge higher, extremely well optimized despite the fact the game looks beautiful, and low file size (at the time of this review) despite the fact that if this was a game by say, Activision or another big studio, this game would be 80-100gs. Gameplay is amazing, great PVE/PVP experience, and compared to other extraction shooters, it's not as punishing. The ARC are truly some of the most fun mob enemies I've ever fought in gaming, extremely cool and unique."

netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.8,Purchased the game today and see how it could have potential but I cannot recommend this right now. Constant matchmaking errors. Quicker to get into a raid in tarkov. Played 4 matches total. Camped by a group in each match trying to extract.
netcode/desync,Optimize server synchronization for fairer gameplay experience in duo mode.,0.9,"Don't let the bad review make you think I hate the game, because I don't. I plan on playing it for a very long time, however there is a glaring issue i kinda cant ignore. Queuing as a Duo."
pve/mission loop,Implement PvE mode,1.0,"Can't really say much, since I barely played. Since I play solo, I'll gladly come back and play again this great game, when/if there will be an option for PvE only. PvP ruins it for me. Since for the time being, I can't enjoy it, because of PvP only, my review will be negative. I'll gladly change my review if they will introduce PvE only."

netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.8,overall the game is filled with extraction campers and and the occasional cheater if you get this game expect everyone to camp and gunfights to be you completing a hard objective and people waiting for the very last moment. oh and good luck with the shit net code that cant function and lets people shoot you through walls and floors.
netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.9,Bought the game and haven't even seen the main menu just constant error no matter what

netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.8,"I really wanted to love Arc Raiders. The original concept — a co-op shooter where you and your team fight back against overwhelming alien forces — was something fresh and exciting. But ever since the focus shifted toward PvP and extraction-style gameplay, the soul of the game has been fading fast."
netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.9,"A warning. The game is very fun, or it was while it was playable. Unfortunately, the game has begun to stutter to literally 0fps during the middle of a raid, occasionally jumping back up to 10fps so I can see my character die. I have contacted Embark support, to no avail; steam support as well. So I caution you to keep your money; I went all in on the deluxe edition, and now have nothing but a broken game and silence to show for it."
netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,1.0,"Needs a hotfix for the Unreal Engine 5 bug where you crash and lose everything in raid to a ""ACCESS MEMORY VIOLATION"" error which is a cause to overclocked systems despite if they are stable or not interacting with UE5.

netcode/desync,Optimize server synchronization to reduce desync issues and rebalance weapon damage curves to make the game more fair.,0.8,"This game was very fun at the beginning, now I can't even extract most times because I keep getting killed by campers that just wait by the extract or wait for you to be attacked by the ARC and then they attack you right after. There is no point in upgrading your gear because whoever gets the first shot off wins Turning into toxic rust quickly."

netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.8,"It is really fun. Hard to pin down why, but even when I get jumped and die it doesn't sting as bad as other games. Time to Kill at least for the first several hours is pretty long so leads to more extended fights."

netcode/desync,Optimize server synchronization to reduce desync issues and improve overall game stability.,0.8,This game is Toxic with Sweaty players. Its more PVP than PVE and you can hardly find a good game that allows perks to working together. Rather you get people that just shoot on sight and no incentive to be a team. Games like this is just a rip off fro Tarkov.
netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,1.0,"Super fun ""casual extraction shooter"", but not sure if it will survive in the long run. You'll get a solid 50+ hours of enjoyment out of it though, and Embark dev studio has released a roadmap with upcoming content to look out for."

Packet loss and server lag is horrendous i cannot get through even the first raid cant fight even the small robots or go up stairs. Ive spent more time googling how to fix these issues than i have actually playing the thing. Waste of money.
netcode/desync,"optimize server synchronization, rebalance weapon damage curves",0.8,"Beware the packet loss, awfully low tickrate and the never ending battle on whether this should've stayed as a PVE game.

netcode/desync,Optimize server synchronization to reduce desync and lag issues.,0.8,"After 20 hourish of playing, I am done with this game. This is nothing but frustration, there is no reward at all. Everything is a struggle and it is a very stressful game wich is not my conception of gaming. I feel like I am working, and I already have a job."
pve/mission loop,Implement PVE-only mode with increased ARC difficulty,1.0,"Imagine a world where the whole server teams up to destroy ARC, exploring this beautiful game, making friends in the process, swapping and gifting your hard earned swag.

netcode/desync,"optimize server synchronization, reduce map size",0.8,"this is my review for now can change with future updates , sound design is garbage you cant tell with precision where players are and to me on an extraction shooter that's a golden rule, desync happening you can be shot and get killed while already on cover, too much IA to deal with together with pvp its just a complete mess, must reduce players per map if you kill a player you cant even loot it cause the whole map is already coming to you"
weapon/ai balance,rebalance weapon damage curves,0.9,"If you want to get head-shot through walls, if you want enemies with the most basic gun to deal two to three times your damage while you’ve got the best gear, and if you enjoy losing all your loot for no reason — this trash game is for you.

netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.9,Great game love extraction shooters so this is right down that ally. With the new patch though I keep losing connection to server must be a new thing that they added.
netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.8,"Only complaint with this game is the Stamina. Takes a while to level up to upgrade the stamina and even with it upgraded, you're walking most of the time. Game is hard enough with the combat, there's no reason running should only last a few seconds especially with the size of the maps. Really hope I'm not alone on this so maybe it will get changed but other than that it's a great game."

Please group trios with trios and duos with duos. There is no bigger vibe kill then when you get into great fights and they just have an edge with an extra person. Otherwise there is literally nothing negative to say about this game. Only reason for a negative review. If this gets changed the game is absolute perfection.
netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,1.0,"What a game! First review in over 20 years on Steam I've felt compelled to write about. It was a choice between this and BF6, so glad I made this choice (even having been a BF fan since BF2)!

I played Division 2 extraction mode a lot and this is very similar but it's really refreshing that not everyone wants to kill you and take your stuff (mostly). The in game team ups have been really unexpected on top of what is already a great PVP/PVE shooter.

When you go to the surface to scavenge, you're always alert to what is happening for the whole duration. The task is optimize server synchronization."
netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.9,"duo team completely unfair. All the time 2on3 fights. How can the developer think this is a fair condition? If this would be fixed, I would recommend the game"

netcode/desync,Optimize server synchronization to reduce lag and improve overall stability in PvP combat.,0.95,The PVP portion of the game has really killed the game for me. There's absolutely no reason I should have to grind 4 or 5 hours to find a piece of gear and then get killed and lose everything you just I've been working on the last few hours. I have 26.5 hours in the game and every single time I have the mats to upgrade a station I get killed by some idiot. I will no be playing this game any more until the PVP side is gone.

The graphics are great and the gameplay is engaging. However, there are a few things that could be improved. For one, the guns feel underpowered compared to other shooters. It would also be nice if we had more customization options for our characters. Additionally, I noticed some lag during certain parts of the game which made it difficult to aim and hit shots. Overall, Fortnite is a great game with room for improvement."
netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,0.9,"game sucks people just kill people for no reason like i come in free with nada and people still be people. spawns are shit and the AI robots are toxic AF, plus spaceport has nothing to loot whoever made that map dropped the ball on lootable areas, cant go for queen cause you get camped for no reason just a all around horrible situation to be in. dont play this game if your weak hearted i cant stop im too addicted to this shit show."

I can understand the appeal of PvP, but when I'm starting out and getting ganked and murdered every single run without fail on Dam, with no way to really make progress, it sucks all the fun out of it. It would be pretty trivial to implement non-pvp servers and maps, and I would definitely return to the game if that were the case. The maps are beautiful, and I want ways to explore them without continuously and endlessly getting ganked."

But there are enough of those who just want to hunt down other players, to make it unenjoyable for the rest. The TTK (time to kill) is way too short for a game where other player's intentions are so ambiguous. So, it ends up being a handful of aggressive players skulking around and gunning down the peaceful ones before they can get a shot off. There is no disincentive for killing other players. You're not marked or flagged in the round and you're not match-made with other aggressive players.

netcode/desync,"optimize server synchronization, improve responsiveness of interface",0.8,"While an engaging game, it's currently hampered by technical issues to the point that I cannot recommend it. Problems range from server issues, including desync, to more simple things like 'stuck player' repeatedly putting you back into the same terrain. Often the interface doesn't respond at all, especially when it requires server interaction, to the point that it feels like player input is a second thought. Simply put, the game itself is often more dangerous than the gameplay."

My only complaint is that their servers are dogshit and lead to some frustrating desync situations like getting shot around walls or corners.

It happens all the time, ""oh the games running well, lets release a patch that FUCKS UP the game for a bunch of people instead of testing it first"". Its a fun game. Its just so frustrating as a parent who doesn't have free time that often, I just want my FUCKING games to work during those very brief moments.

Now onto gameplay is pretty fun with the arc robots and player aspects but I will have to point out the desync issues the game has, its really bad and hope they fix it soon enough cause being shot when behind cover cause on the other player end your character just disappears is frustrating."

Now if I decide that I want to bring a good kit in I risk the chance of losing it because the game said so. This random Glitch is unacceptable. I literally lose before I have the chance to do anything when I load in because the game doesn't let me move. The game also crashes sometimes.

netcode/desync,optimize server synchronization,1.0,"I've played this game since Tech Test 2 (April 2025). I missed this game so much when it was still being developed, and have impatiently waited for its release. This game has lived up to every one of my expectations and beyond. The lack of hit confirmations just gives a sense of realism, and the flare knockout confirmation is a surprisingly good touch. Weapon variety is perfect for launch, but playing free loadout has made weapon selection seem narrow. Too many weapons and players wouldn't be able to pick fights based on what guns they hear (which would be detrimental). The inventory mechanics, with augments, shields, quick use, and a confidence level of 1.0, are fantastic. A task that could improve the game is optimizing server synchronization."
